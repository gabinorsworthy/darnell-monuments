# Darnell Monuments

Darnell Monuments is a custom designed and developed WordPress theme/website for the Darnell Monuments client.
The project was completed in two stages: Design and Development.

# Design

**This website was initially designed with Figma before jumping into development.** I worked with the client to collect what exactly they wanted on the site and how they might
want it displayed. From there, I drafted a design and got approval from the client.

Once I got the client's approval, I developed an entire responsive site before deciding the design wasn't a good fit.
I got back with the client, drafted a completely new design, and started development more-or-less from scratch.
Thankfully, this design was one both my client and myself liked much better than the original.

# Development

As stated, the initial site was completed in plain HTML and CSS.
However, **the second, and final site, was created using PHP and JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS.**

After the first round of development, I also decided to start utilizing the Content Management System (CMS) provided by WordPress (.org).
By using WordPress, I could create user-friendly "forms" for the client to update their information and then pull the new information using embedded PHP in the site's HTML.
This proved to be a user-friendly and great long-term solution for site maintenance both for myself and the client.

For WordPress, the website you're developing is called a "theme" and requires a certain file heirarchy.
However, once you've got the initial folders and files set up, it's just like developing any other website!
**Just like other websites, I wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the site from scratch,
and while a majority of these files are labeled as PHP, most of the content inside those files is HTML with embedded PHP.**

While developing the site I used XAMPP to develop locally until I felt the site was ready to demo to the client.

# Takeaways

Taking on this project was a crazy exciting learning opportunity for me.
I had just started exploring the world of web development less than a year before Darnell Monuments asked me to build their site,
so I was understandably intimidated when presented with this huge task for their company.
However, the responsibility of this project encouraged me to dive deeper into web development than I had before 
and proved to be a great opportunity to learn about the process of designing, developing, and launching a website.

While the site is up and live, I already have ideas on what's next for this project and can't wait to
continue to learn as I implement these new ideas.
