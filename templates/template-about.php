            When Jeff worked as a Coke delivery worker, he would make sure his last stop
            was a monument business in a nearby town. This allowed Jeff to watch designs
            come to life as each stone was engraved. One day Jeff came home and discussed
            buying the monument business because the owner was retiring. We tried to buy
            the business, but the owner’s family decided to take the business over, so Jeff
            gave up on his dream.
            <br/><br/>
            A few years later, Jeff was working at General Tire and the plant announced it was
            closing. Jeff decided to follow his dream. Jeff offered to work for free at a
            monument business in a nearby town in order to learn the trade. General Tire
            was not going to close for about a year, so on Jeff’s days off, he would work at the
            monument business. He learned how to draw designs, how to engrave, and how
            to set stones.
            <br/><br/>
            We converted our barn into an office and sandblasting shop, and Jeff took
            business classes at a nearby two-year college to learn how to run the business.
            Jeff was laid off, about a year later, and we opened Darnell Monuments beside
            our home on 6 acres just outside of town.
